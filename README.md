Flappy Miao
-----------
A HTML5 game/demo, imitating Flappy Bird.
This demo was based on [Egret Engine][2].

[Preview][1]

1. Wait for seconds to load the game.(Maybe minutes, due to big pics)
2. Resize the game(by zoom in/out) to fit in the browser.(Due to bad design at the first time, it can't adapt to screens, so only works on PC than phones)
3. Click the lolipop to start game.

All pictures/resources come from the Internet and my phone camera.

Hope you like it. :p
May you be happy all the time.

**NOTE:** The *linux version* of Egret game engine hasn't updated since v1.03.
